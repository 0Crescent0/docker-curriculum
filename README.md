## Getting Started: FAQs

### What is Docker?
Wikipedia defines [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as 

> an open-source project that automates the deployment of software applications inside **containers** by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of **OS-level virtualization** on Linux.

Wow! That's a mouthful. In simpler words, Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called *containers*) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to **package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit** for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have the high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.


### What are containers?

The industry standard today is to use Virtual Machines (VMs) to run software applications. VMs run applications inside a guest Operating System, which runs on virtual hardware powered by the server’s host OS.

VMs are great at providing full process isolation for applications: there are very few ways a problem in the host operating system can affect the software running in the guest operating system, and vice-versa. But this isolation comes at great cost — the computational overhead spent virtualizing hardware for a guest OS to use is substantial.

Containers take a different approach: by leveraging the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, containers provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power.


### Why should I use it?

As developers, we are cognizant of the power we hold in our hands - the ability to build apps to share with the entire world is very empowering. However, one key aspect of that realization involves deploying our application either on the cloud, a datacenter or even a single server. Given that apps today involve so many components - an application server, a database, a caching layer etc. deploying and managing these architectures is extremely complex.

By standardizing an application and its dependencies into a container, Docker enables us to build, test and release our apps quickly and easily. Due to its benefits of efficiency and portability, Docker has been gaining mindshare rapidly is now leading the **Containerization** movement. As a developer going out into the world, it is important that we understand this trend and see how we can benefit from it.

### What will this tutorial teach me?
This tutorial will give you a hands-on experience with deploying a docker container on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) (AWS). It will demystify the docker landscape, clarify the differences between images and containers and finally, deploy a python application on the cloud.

## Using this Document
This document contains a series of several sections, each of which explains a particular aspect of Docker. In each section, we will be typing commands (or writing code). All the code used in the tutorial is available in the [Github repo](http://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum).

## Preface

<a id="prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites
There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor. Prior experience in developing web applications would be helpful but not required. As we proceed further along the tutorial, we'll make use of a few services. If you're interested in following along, please create an account on each of these websites - 

- [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

### Setting up your computer
Getting all the tooling setup on your computer can be a daunting task, but thankfully as Docker has become stable getting it up and running on your favorite OS has become very easy. At first, we'll install docker.

##### Docker 
Until a few releases ago, running docker on OSX and Windows was quite a hassle. Lately, however, docker has invested significantly into improving the onboarding experience for its users on platforms and hence running Docker now is simple. The *getting started* guide on Docker has detailed instructions for setting up Docker on [Mac](http://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/), [Linux](http://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/) and [Windows](http://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/).

To test your docker installation, run the following
```
$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

##### Python
Python comes pre-installed on OSX and (most) Linux distributions. We'll also be using [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/) for installing packages for our application.

If don't have pip installed, please [download](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/) it for your system.

```
$ python --version
python --version
Python 2.7.10

$ pip --version
pip 7.1.2 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-7.1.2-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
```

##### Java
The app that we'll be developing will be using [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for storage and search. In order to run elasticsearch locally, make sure you Java installed. If Java is installed, typing `java -version` in your terminal should give you an output similar to the one below.

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)
```
